# About
Hi, my full name is Nguyen Van Quang. I am a software developer specializing in mobile development (native Android and iOS). I have built dozens of mobile apps from concept to delivery and maintenance stage. When I was in university, I built and published apps which got more than a million of downloads totally. Besides, I am also an [open-source contributor](https://github.com/quangctkm9207) and [blogger](http://emo-pass.com/blog/).

## Building things
Building crafts was what I enjoyed as a kid, some of them were really useful, and others just were silly funny things.  
When I was in university, I was really interested in Android and learned to develop apps which got more than a million of downloads totally, the most successful one has been downloaded more than 300,000 times.
Some of them still can be found on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=EmoPass+Studio).  
At that time, I went through all stages of a development process which includes sketching idea, planning, designing, coding, releasing and marketing.  

At that time, **design, software, and entrepreneur** took my time and passion equally.

## Software development
Software development was planned to be the main focus in my career path. Especially, I continued to put my efforts on mobile development in which I expanded my skills to work with both iOS and Android. In addition to **clean codes**, I evaluated **effective development process**.  

## Beauty in technical things
The more time I spend on software, the more I see its beauty, especially in purely abstract layers (which are independent to libraries, frameworks, programming languages, and even time). After exploring various things beyond mobile world, the followings are what I care the most to build and deliver high-quality software products.
* Robust architecture and design.
* Clean, extendable, and maintainable codes.
* Agile, effective development stack.
