# About
My full name is Nguyen Van Quang. Currently, I am a software developer who is always on the way to refactor his products and himself.

## Building stuffs
When I was in university, I enjoyed building Android apps which got more than a million of downloads totally, the most successful one has been downloaded more than 300,000 times.
Some of these apps still can be found on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=EmoPass+Studio).  
Being a solo man was really fun at that time. In my own studio, I went through all stages of a development process which includes sketching idea, planning, designing, coding, releasing and promoting.  

At that time, **design, software, and entrepreneur** took my time and passion equally.

## Software development
After graduating, software development was planned to be the main focus in my career path. Especially, I continued to put my efforts on mobile development in which I expanded my skills to work with both iOS and Android. In addition to **clean codes**, I evaluated **effective development process**.  

## Beauty in technical things
The more time I spend on software, the more I see its beauty, especially in purely abstract layers (which are independent to libraries, frameworks, programming languages, and even time). After exploring various things beyond mobile world, the followings are what I care the most to build and deliver high-quality software products.
* Robust architecture and design.
* Clean, extendable, and maintainable codes.
* Agile, effective development stack.
