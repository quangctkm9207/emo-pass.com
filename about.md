# About
I am Quang, a young and professional developer, who was born in a Vietnamese peaceful village but currently working in Kyoto, Japan.  

What I am passionate are software development, design, and entrepreneur. Mobile development, however, is taken as my main focus.

## Online life
As a software enthusiast, especially mobile developer, I sit in front of computer screen and work on some awesome projects or exploring internet world for many hours every day. Coding, blogging and exploring new things are really exciting things to me.  

Via several social network channel, you might see me contributing to open source projects on [Github](https://github.com/quangctkm9207), posting articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@quangctkm9207),or solving some funny problems on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/quangctkm9207). Besides, if you are my Facebook friend, you maybe find my comments on what you share or post there.  

## Offline life
After working time, you might see me at a coffee shop every weekend. Sometimes, I spend time walking around my apartment.
Besides, I spend most of my leisure time with my Kindle and its world.  

In 2015, I spent two valuable months to travel across my country after graduating. I explored wonderful places and especially to learn about different people in each province. It is one of my most memorial experience which has changed my thinking a lot.

After that, I came to work in Japan and had really a good chance to learn and experience Japanese culture, and especially people.
